Flutter Haveno is a client interface written in dart for the [Haveno](https://www.haveno.com) peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized exchange. This package provides a seamless way for Flutter developers to integrate Haveno's decentralized trading platform into their mobile and desktop applications through the daemons inuitive gRPC channel.
